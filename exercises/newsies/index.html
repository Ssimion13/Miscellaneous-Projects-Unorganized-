    <h2> Armistice Signed, End Of The War! Berlin Seized By Revolutionists; New Chancellor Begs For Order </h2>

    <p class="text"> <em> Washington, Monday, Nov. 11, 2:48 A.M. </em> --The armistice between Germany, on the one hand, and the allied Governments and the United States, on the other, has been signed.

      The State Department announced at 2:45 o'clock this morning that Germany had signed.

      The department's announcement simply said: <em> "The armistice has been signed." </em>

      The world war will end this morning at <strong> 6 o'clock, Washington time, 11 o'clock Paris time. </strong>

      The armistice was signed by the German representatives at midnight. This announcement was made by the State Department at 2:50 o'clock this morning.

      The announcement was made verbally by an official of the State Department in this form:

      "The armistice has been signed. It was signed at 5 o'clock A.M., Paris time, [midnight, New York time,] and hostilities will cease at 11 o'clock this morning, Paris time, [6 o'clock, New York time.]

      The terms of the armistice, it was announced, will not be made public until later. Military men here, however, regard it as certain that they include:

      <strong> Immediate retirement of the German military forces from France, Belgium, and Alsace- Lorraine.

      Disarming and demobilization of the German armies. </strong>  Occupation by the allied and American forces of such strategic points in Germany as will make impossible a renewal of hostilities.

        Delivery of part of the German High Seas Fleet and a certain number of submarines to the allied and American naval forces.

       <p class="classified">  「belong」は「属する」という意味の動詞なので、「* are belong」のように前にbe動詞がくることはない。また、「belong」は状態動詞でもあり、be動詞を用いて「* are belonging」という進行形にすることもできない。
「all」とする以上、基地は複数あるのだから、「base」は複数形「bases」にする必要がある。
「base」には形容詞としての用法もあり、そう解釈すると「all your base」は「あなたの全ての悪徳（卑劣）なこと」とも読める[4]。
英語として成立する最低限の修正を加えると、次のようになる。

「All [of] your base[s] belong to us.」（君達の全ての基地は我々の支配下だ。）
さらに自然な英語で表現するならば、以下のような文が考えられる。

「CATS has taken all of your bases.」（君達の基地は、全てCATSがいただいた。）
「CATS has taken over every last one of your bases.」（君達の基地は、一つ残らずCATSがいただいた。）
「All of your bases have been taken (over).」（君達の基地は、すべて我々の統制下だ。）
本項の英語版にも日本語文と英訳例が記載されているため参照されたい。

  Disarmament of all other German warships under supervision of the allied and American Navies, which will guard them.

  Occupation of the principal German naval bases by sea forces of the victorious nations.

  Release of allied and American soldiers, sailors, and civilians held prisoners in Germany without such reciprocal action by the associated Governments.

  <em> There was no information as to the circumstances under which the armistice was signed, but since the German courier did not reach German military headquarters until 10 o'clock yesterday morning, French time, it was generally assumed here that the German envoys within the French lines had been instructed by wireless to sign the terms. </em>

  Forty-seven hours had been required for the courier to reach the German headquarters, and unquestionably several hours were necessary for the examination of the terms and a decision.
