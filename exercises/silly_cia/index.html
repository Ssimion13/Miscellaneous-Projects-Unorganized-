  <p>     LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the <br> CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the <br> CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands <br> of pages of critical intelligence information with black <br> highlighters. <br> 

       According to the report, sections of the documents— <br>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are <br> marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines <br> impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting <br> policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.<br><br>

       CIA Director <strong> Porter Goss </strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the <br> particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>  The Cold War </li>
    <li>  The civil-rights movement </li>
    <li>  The growth of the international drug trade </li>
  </ul>
