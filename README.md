V School Assignments  
====================

This is the main README file for all of my assignments from V School.
Each of the directories in this directory represents a warmup (daily, short practices),
exercises (completed immediately after learning a new topic),
or a project (used to test my ability in given areas of development) that I've worked on during my time here.
The projects all contain a README file that explains the assignment given as well as a summary of what I learned by completing the assignment.
Depending on the difficulty of the assignment and material, a readme is contained within those respectively.
