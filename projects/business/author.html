  <h3> About Me </h3>
<p> As an Army civilian attorney and Air Force judge advocate, for 30 years I was an accomplished writer of legal briefs. Those briefs sometimes seemed like fiction,
but I always dreamed of writing a different kind of fiction, one speculating on how life might actually be on other worlds. </p>

<h4> What is the inspiration for the story? </h4>

<p> Zarmina itself is my inspiration. It’s a real exoplanet thought to lie within the circumstellar habitability zone of the dwarf star, Gliese 581.
Assuming human life was possible there, what challenges would we face in colonizing it?. Where did the idea for this book come from? </p>

<p> The main character, John Smith, is just a regular guy. He's not a scientist, not a genius, not a superhero.
  He's just doing his best to survive, protect his family and maybe do some good for mankind in this new, alien world --
   but human conflicts thrust him into a leadership role. </p>

<h4> What did you learn while writing this book? </h4>

<p> How hard an interstellar colonization mission would actually be. It’s not just the technical difficulty of traveling dozens of light-years,
   it’s not knowing what you’ll find when you get there. Spaceships have limited power and cargo capacity – and a limited budget.
   Did you bring the right stuff? </p
