    <p>   Astronomers initially thought it rather an inconsequential star, a red dwarf star in the Libra constellation about twenty light-years from Earth.  With a mass thought to be one-third that of Earth’s own sun, the star was so inconsequential that they simply gave it the numerical designation “Gliese 581” instead of something more important and impressive like “Polaris” or “Sirius.”  Despite its inauspicious start, Gliese 581 gained prominence in the early 2000s when scientists detected a solar system and theorized that it might harbor a “circumstellar habitability zone,” the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface might support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure. <br><br> </p>

<p>  The problem that plagued science was the difficulty in proving exactly what was out there and what it all meant.  The radial velocity method – tiny Doppler shifts in the starlight as a planet’s gravity tugs on a star and one of the most reliable methods of identifying exoplanets-- established and confirmed the likely existence of three planets orbiting Gliese 581 in 2005, followed by confirmation of a fourth planet in 2009.  These planets were confirmed by study of planetary transits, which occur when the orbiting planet passes in front of the star and blocks a tiny fraction of its light. <br><br></p>

<p> The existence of possible fifth and sixth planets were announced in 2010 based on analysis of gravitational data.  Since these planets did not transit Gliese 581, confirmation by planetary transit was impossible.  A hot debate was touched off when another team, using a different radial velocity spectrograph, disputed the very existence of these planets.  They argued that the discoverers had erroneously assumed the planets had circular orbits and that the results would be completely different if the planets had elliptical orbits – and of course, nobody knew what kind of orbits any of the planets had.  Yet another group of scientists used Bayesian analysis -- which examines the statistical certainty of a set of observations -- concluded that the additional planets did not exist because the amount of background “noise” in the data had been underestimated.  The team that discovered the two planets, led by Steve Vogt, tested and retested and held firm to their conclusion. <br><br>

<p>  The one thing all the scientists largely agreed on was that one or more of the planets in the Gliese 581 system might be within the habitability zone.  Which planets might lie within it remained mere academic speculation until Vogt unofficially named one of the disputed planets, Gliese 581 g, after his wife, Zarmina, and was quoted by the Mercury News as saying that Zarmina “may well be like Earth, where you could walk around comfortably and look out at the stars.”  The media-friendly name and possibility of life on an alien planet captured the public’s imagination.  The article was followed by a frenzy of media speculation of what explorers might actually find on Zarmina – assuming, of course, that Zarmina actually existed. <br><br> </p>

<p> And so the debate raged for decades, unprovable because Gliese 581 was simply too far away and too weak a star to give solid data.  In the late 2060s, the Branson-Musk interstellar drive finally offered the possibility of proof.  That’s where my story begins. <br>
